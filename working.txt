   - Consider setting random intervals (between 45 to 120 seconds) for refreshing.

4. Labeling and Filtering:

5. Refreshing Interval:
   - Adjust the application to refresh at random intervals (45 to 120 seconds) rather than every 10 seconds.

6. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error handling and logging to capture and address any issues during the process.
